## About

This is the backend for the Maths equation tutor. We are required to write an application that solves for equations 2x - 2 = 10 and 2(4x + 3) + 6= 9 - 4x and provides the steps for solving the equation.

## Getting Started

1. Make sure you have [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/) and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) installed.
2. Install your dependencies

   ```
   cd path/to/back-end
   npm install
   ```

3. Start your app

   ```
   npm run compile # Compile TypeScript source
   npm start
   ```

## Testing

Run `npm test` and all your tests in the `test/` directory will be run.

# Equations Tested:

    - 2(4x + 3) + 6= 9 - 4x
    - 3x + 2 = 9 - 4x
    - 2x - 2 = 10
    - 2(4x + 3) + 6 = 2x + 2
    - 2(4x + 3) + 6 = 2x
    - 2(4x + 3) + 6 = 10
    - 4x + 3 = 2x
    - 7x - 2 = 10x
